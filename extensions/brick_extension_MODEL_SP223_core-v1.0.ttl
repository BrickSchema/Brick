A ConnectionPoint is an abstract modeling construct used to represent the fact that one connectable thing can be connected to another connectable thing using a Connection. It is the abstract representation of the flange, wire terminal, or other physical feature where a connection is made. Equipment and DomainSpaces can have one or more ConnectionPoints (see `s223:Connectable` and `s223:Connection`).

A ConnectionPoint must constrained to relate to a specific medium such as air, water, or electricity which determines what other things can be connected to it. For example, constraining a ConnectionPoint to be for air means it cannot be used for an electrical connection.

A ConnectionPoint belongs to exactly one connectable thing.

ConnectionPoints are represented graphically in this standard by a triangle with the point indicating a direction of flow, or a diamond in the case of a bidirectional connection as shown in Figure 5-2.
