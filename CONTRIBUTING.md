## Reporting Bugs and Issues

Reporting of bugs and issues should be done on the [Brick GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/BrickSchema/brick-owl-dl/issues). The purview of "bugs and issues" includes (but is not limited to):

- missing, incomplete or incorrect definitions of Brick classes
- errors, mistakes or inconsistencies in the Brick ontology definition

Bug reports are most helpful when they fully explain the problem and include as many details as possible.
Some suggestions:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue that identifies the problem
- **Include as many details as possible** about the problem, including any relevant Brick/SPARQL queries, RDF triples, segments of Turtle files, Python code, etc
- **Describe the observed and expected behavior**: for example, what query did you run, what were the results, and what did you expect the results to be? What definition exists and what definition would you expect?
- **Describe the exact steps to reproducing the problem** where it is appropriate: did you execute a query and 
- Make sure you are using the most recent version of the Brick repository

## Proposing Changes to Brick

The content, structure and extent of Brick is determined by its community, so suggestions for how to improve Brick are always welcome and will be taken under consideration.
Proposed changes to Brick are tracked on the [Brick GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/BrickSchema/brick-owl-dl/issues).

Effective proposals should fully explain the motivation and scope of the proposed changes, and should have at least an initial impression of the nature of the implementation.
The more detail, the better!
