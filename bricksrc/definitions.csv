Mathematically, the torque on a particle (which has the position r in some reference frame) can be defined as the cross product: (τ = r x F) where, r is the particle's position vector relative to the fulcrum  F is the force acting on the particles,  or, more generally, torque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum: (τ = dL/dt) where, L is the angular momentum vector  t stands for time.",
